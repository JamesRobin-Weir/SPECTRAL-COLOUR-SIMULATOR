Simulation of colour based on Gaussian System (by Gaussian, Inc.) data of electron energy states in a material with fitting of TD-DFT transitions to experimental UV–visible spectra based in part on the publication of similar name by Éric A.G. Brémond, Jérôme Kieffer, Carlo Adamo (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.theochem.2010.04.038).

To run, unzip and execute Spectral-colour-simulator-2025.py. The .zip format may remove file extensions, so simply rename files as .txt if not recognised by code.
