Simulation of colour based on Gaussian System (by Gaussian, Inc.) data of electron energy states in a material with fitting of TD-DFT transitions to experimental UV–visible spectra based in part on the publication of similar name by Éric A.G. Brémond, Jérôme Kieffer, Carlo Adamo (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.theochem.2010.04.038).

To run, unzip and execute Spectral-colour-simulator-2025.py. The .zip format may remove file extensions, so simply rename files as .txt if not recognised by code. Two copies of the data files are provided (with and without .txt) for this purpose. This code will run and identify these local data files on windows and unix systems. It has not and will not be tested on mac.
